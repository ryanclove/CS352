1. Antoino Ignarra aji44 and Ryan Coslove rmc326

2. There are no known bugs/errors.

3. When looking at the resources given for the project, using the code from
the recitation template and websites like https://routley.io/posts/hand-writing-dns-messages/,
https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html, and https://wiki.python.org/moin/UdpCommunication,
allowed this project to make more sense. The instructions weren't hard, just reading
from those websites gave a clearer understanding of what was expected. This took 2-3 
days, maybe 15-20 total hours (we did not keep track).
