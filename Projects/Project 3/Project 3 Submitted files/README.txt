0. me and my partner

1. We created two sockets, one to each TS. There was a timeout designated for
each socket in the event a server went down.

2. We were unable to get the ls to send back to the client with an appropriate
answer.

3. Problems we faced were connecting our answer to the client to be outputted
and figuring out the dynamics of timeouts

4. We learned how timeouts are implemented and that we underestimated this project
and we shouldn't have but I think our brains are getting tired from the semester
being so close to finishing. Please be gentle

Just so our resources are known, we referenced recitations from class (7-on),
and our project 2 which also used recitations and websites like
https://routley.io/posts/hand-writing-dns-messages/,
https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html, and
https://wiki.python.org/moin/UdpCommunication,
