0. Me and a partner
1. We implemented the recursive client by first establishing a connection to the root DNS seerver.
Once a query was not in the root servers' DNS table, we recieved the address of the top level DNS
server. We established this connection, and then for each query onward we first consulted the root
server, and if the query was not in the root servers' DNS table, we queried the top level server
which searched its DNS table for the appropriate response.
2. There are no known issues with the attached code.
3. While developing, the biggest issue we faced was figuring out the algorithm for the client, and
how to structure our code to implement a recursive lookup.
4. We became more familiar with how recursive lookups are implemented and more comfortable with
socket programming. We also became more familiar with argparse in this project.
